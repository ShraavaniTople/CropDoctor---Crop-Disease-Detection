# CropDoctor-Crop-Disease-Detection
Crop Disease Detection is a machine learning project aimed at helping farmers identify and treat plant diseases early to improve crop yield and reduce losses. The project involves building a deep learning model that can classify images of crops into healthy or diseased categories.

# Project Structure:
1)Data Collection: Collect a dataset of images containing healthy and diseased crops. This dataset should cover a variety of crops and diseases to ensure the model's robustness.

2)Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the images to ensure uniformity and compatibility with the model. This may involve resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the dataset.

3)Model Building: Develop a deep learning model for image classification. A common approach is to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) due to their effectiveness in handling image data.

4)Model Training: Train the CNN model using the preprocessed dataset. Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.

5)Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This step helps in understanding the model's strengths and weaknesses.

6)Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model to a web application or mobile app interface where users, especially farmers, can upload images of their crops and receive predictions on whether they are healthy or diseased.
