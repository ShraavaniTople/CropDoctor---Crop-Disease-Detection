# CropDoctor-Crop-Disease-Detection
The Crop Disease Detection project leverages deep learning techniques to assist farmers in identifying and managing crop diseases effectively. Through the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a diverse dataset of crop images, the model accurately classifies crops as healthy or diseased, aiding in early detection and intervention. This comprehensive solution encompasses data preprocessing techniques such as image augmentation and normalization, model training with TensorFlow and Keras, and a user-friendly web interface deployed with Flask. By seamlessly integrating machine learning and web development, this project empowers farmers with an intuitive tool to enhance crop health monitoring and optimize agricultural practices.

# Project Structure:
1)Data Collection: Collect a dataset of images containing healthy and diseased crops. This dataset should cover a variety of crops and diseases to ensure the model's robustness.

2)Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the images to ensure uniformity and compatibility with the model. This may involve resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the dataset.

3)Model Building: Develop a deep learning model for image classification. A common approach is to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) due to their effectiveness in handling image data.

4)Model Training: Train the CNN model using the preprocessed dataset. Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.

5)Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This step helps in understanding the model's strengths and weaknesses.

6)Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model to a web application or mobile app interface where users, especially farmers, can upload images of their crops and receive predictions on whether they are healthy or diseased.
